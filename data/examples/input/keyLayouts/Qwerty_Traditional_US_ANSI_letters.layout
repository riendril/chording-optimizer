# KeyLayout: QWERTY
# Keyboard Format: Traditional (row-staggered)
# Keyset: Letters only
# Compatible host layout interpretations: US ANSI

# Format: "char" [vertical_offset, horizontal_offset]
# Vertical offset: +1 = reach up, -1 = reach down (from home row)
# Horizontal offset: Measured as spreading/pinching of fingers relative to hand's center
#   Positive = fingers spread outward (stretch)
#   Negative = fingers move inward (pinch)
# All measurements in approximate key units not considering distance between keys
