# Chording Concepts

## What is Chording Alongside Typing?

Chording alongside typing is a text input method that combines traditional typing with **chord combinations** - pressing multiple keys simultaneously to output entire words, phrases, or character sequences. This hybrid approach allows users to maintain their existing typing skills while gaining efficiency through strategic use of chords for frequently used text.

## Core Concepts

### Chords vs. Traditional Typing

- **Traditional Typing**: Press keys sequentially to spell out words letter by letter
- **Chording**: Press multiple keys simultaneously to output complete tokens instantly
- **Hybrid Approach**: Use both methods together - type normally for most text, use chords for common patterns

### Key Terms

- **Token**: A sequence of characters (word, phrase, or pattern) that can be triggered by a chord
- **Chord/Combo**: A combination of keys pressed simultaneously to output a token
- **Assignment**: The mapping between a specific chord and its assigned token
- **Corpus**: Text data representative of your typical typing patterns

## How Chording Enhances Efficiency

### Frequency-Based Optimization

The optimizer analyzes your text patterns to identify:

- Most frequently used words and phrases
- Common character sequences
- Repetitive patterns in your writing

These high-frequency elements become candidates for chord assignment, maximizing the efficiency gains.

### Ergonomic Considerations

Not all key combinations are equally comfortable. The optimizer considers:

- **Finger Independence**: Avoiding awkward finger combinations
- **Hand Balance**: Distributing chords across both hands
- **Stretch Minimization**: Preferring comfortable key reaches
- **Same-Finger Avoidance**: Preventing multiple keys on the same finger

### Usage Examples

#### Common Words

- Chord `qw` → "the"
- Chord `er` → "and"
- Chord `ty` → "that"

#### Programming Patterns

- Chord `df` → "function"
- Chord `cv` → "const"
- Chord `bn` → "return"

#### Phrases with Spaces

- Chord `gh` → "I think "
- Chord `jk` → "you can "
- Chord `ui` → "in the "

## Benefits of This Approach

### Efficiency Gains

- **Reduced Keystrokes**: Common words/phrases require only one chord press
- **Maintained Flow**: No need to switch input modes or learn entirely new layouts
- **Scalable Learning**: Start with a few chords, gradually add more

### Flexibility

- **Corpus-Specific**: Optimize for your actual writing patterns
- **Layout-Agnostic**: Works with any keyboard layout (QWERTY, Colemak, etc.)
- **Customizable**: Adjust parameters based on your preferences and comfort

### Compatibility

- **Existing Skills**: Builds upon rather than replaces traditional typing
- **Gradual Adoption**: Can be learned incrementally
- **Fallback**: Always possible to type traditionally when chords aren't available

## Learning Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation

1. Start with 10-20 most frequent words in your corpus
2. Practice until chord usage becomes automatic
3. Focus on maintaining typing accuracy

### Phase 2: Expansion

1. Add 20-30 more tokens based on your specific patterns
2. Include common phrases and character sequences
3. Optimize chord assignments based on usage data

### Phase 3: Specialization

1. Add domain-specific tokens (programming, writing, etc.)
2. Fine-tune assignments based on ergonomic feedback
3. Achieve optimal balance between chords and traditional typing

## Technical Implementation

The optimizer handles the complex task of:

- **Corpus Analysis**: Identifying optimal token candidates from your text
- **Chord Generation**: Creating all valid key combinations within ergonomic constraints
- **Assignment Optimization**: Finding the best mapping between tokens and chords
- **Ergonomic Scoring**: Ensuring comfortable and sustainable chord patterns

This allows you to focus on learning and using the chords rather than determining what they should be.
